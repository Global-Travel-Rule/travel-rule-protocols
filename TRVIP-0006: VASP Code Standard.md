# **VASP Code Standard and Logic**

## **Introduction**

A **VASP Code** is a standardized identifier for Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) used to facilitate compliant
transactions, particularly under the **FATF Travel Rule**. It functions similarly to SWIFT codes in traditional banking
but is tailored for different types of cryptocurrency service providers, including:

- **CENTRALIZED EXCHANGES (CEX)**
- **DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGES (DEX)**
- **CUSTODIAL WALLETS (CW)**
- **NON-CUSTODIAL WALLETS (NCW)**
- **TRAVEL RULE SERVICE PROVIDERS (TRSP)**

## **VASP Code Structure**

A VASP Code follows a structured format to ensure uniqueness and interoperability:

| Section       | Length                | Description                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **VASP_NAME** | Full name (Uppercase) | Full name of the registered VASP in uppercase               |
| **VASP_TYPE** | 2-4 letters           | VASP Type (CEX, DEX, CW, NCW, TRSP)                         |
| **COUNTRY**   | 2 letters             | Country code (ISO 3166-1, e.g., "US" for the United States) |
| ****          | 1 Letter              | M:Master account , S: Sub account                           |

**Example VASP Codes:**

- **BINANCE-CEX-US-R** â†’ BINANCE (CEX), United States
- **UNISWAP-DEX-GB-O** â†’ UNISWAP (DEX), United Kingdom
- **METAMASK-CW-SG-O** â†’ METAMASK (CUSTODIAL WALLET), Singapore
- **TREZOR-NCW-JP-O** â†’ TREZOR (NON-CUSTODIAL WALLET), Japan
- **CODE-TRSP-CH-R** â†’ TRISA (TRAVEL RULE SERVICE PROVIDER), Korean

## **VASP Code Logic & Functionality**

### **1. Unique VASP Identification**

- Each registered VASP receives a unique code from a **global VASP registry**.
- Prevents fraudulent or unverified entities from participating in virtual asset transfers.

### **2. Differentiation by VASP Type**

| VASP Type                               | Code | Description                                                     |
|-----------------------------------------|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CENTRALIZED EXCHANGE (CEX)**          | CEX  | Platforms like BINANCE, COINBASE that control user assets       |
| **DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGE (DEX)**        | DEX  | Protocol-based trading platforms like UNISWAP, SUSHISWAP        |
| **CUSTODIAL WALLET (CW)**               | CW   | Wallets where private keys are managed by the provider          |
| **NON-CUSTODIAL WALLET (NCW)**          | NCW  | Wallets where users retain full control over their private keys |
| **TRAVEL RULE SERVICE PROVIDER (TRSP)** | TRSP | Compliance service providers like TRISA, Notabene               |

### **3. Interoperability Across Networks**

- Enables secure messaging between exchanges, custodians, and regulated entities.
- Ensures compliance with **IVMS 101**, **ISO 20022**, and FATF guidelines.

### **4. FATF Travel Rule Compliance**

- When transferring funds, the VASP Code helps **verify and track** sender/recipient information.
- Mandatory **Know Your Customer (KYC) & Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks** are applied.

### **5. Transaction Routing & Messaging**

- Similar to SWIFT, VASP Codes help in the **routing of transactions** between compliant VASPs.
- Uses **secure messaging protocols** like TRP (Travel Rule Protocol) or OpenVASP.

### **6. Security & Privacy Measures**

- Utilizes **zero-knowledge proofs** and **private key cryptography** for identity validation.
- Integrates with on-chain and off-chain compliance tools to detect illicit activity.

## **How VASP Codes Work in Transactions**

### **Scenario: Cross-Exchange Crypto Transfer**

1. **User initiates a withdrawal** from **Exchange A (BINANCE-CEX-US)** to **Exchange B (COINBASE-CEX-US)**.
2. **Exchange A queries the global VASP directory** to verify **COINBASE-CEX-US**.
3. **Exchange A sends a transaction request** with KYC-compliant sender information.
4. **Exchange B validates the request** and ensures compliance with AML/KYC regulations.
5. **Crypto transfer is executed** and recorded on the blockchain, with off-chain KYC verification logs.

## **Comparison: SWIFT Code vs. VASP Code**

| Feature        | SWIFT Code (Banking)        | VASP Code (Crypto)               |
|----------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Use Case**   | Bank transactions           | Crypto transactions              |
| **Regulation** | FATF, ISO 9362              | FATF, IVMS 101                   |
| **Length**     | 8-11 characters             | VASP full name + 5-10 characters |
| **Network**    | SWIFT                       | TRP, OpenVASP, FATF Networks     |
| **Privacy**    | High (bank confidentiality) | Privacy-preserving compliance    |

## **Next Steps for Implementing a VASP Code Standard**

1. **Adopt IVMS 101 as a common data format.**
2. **Integrate a global VASP directory for identity verification.**
3. **Use secure messaging protocols like OpenVASP or TRP.**
4. **Ensure AML/KYC compliance and real-time transaction monitoring.**
