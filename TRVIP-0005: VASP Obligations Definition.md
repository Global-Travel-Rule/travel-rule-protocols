[# **VASP Obligations Definition**

### Introduction

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule establishes regulatory requirements for Virtual Asset Service
Providers (VASPs) to enhance transparency and mitigate financial crime risks associated with virtual asset transactions.
This paper defines the obligations of VASPs under the FATF Travel Rule, focusing on compliance measures, data-sharing
responsibilities, and risk mitigation strategies. Key obligations include customer due diligence (CDD), collection and
transmission of originator and beneficiary information, secure data handling, and collaboration with other VASPs and
regulators. Additionally, this paper outlines the technical and operational challenges in implementing the Travel Rule,
addressing issues such as interoperability, regulatory variations across jurisdictions, and privacy concerns. By
adhering to these obligations, VASPs can strengthen anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT)
efforts, ensuring regulatory compliance while fostering trust within the virtual asset ecosystem.

## Travel Rule (GTR) Obligations

The **Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Travel Rule** requires **Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs)** to collect,
verify, and transmit key identity information for originators and beneficiaries of virtual asset transactions. This
document outlines the obligations of different categories of VASPs and wallet providers, explaining their
responsibilities in ensuring compliance with the Travel Rule.

## 1. VASP (Regulated)

Regulated VASPs must ensure compliance with jurisdictional AML/CFT regulations, collecting and verifying user
information before processing transactions.

### 1.1 VASP(O) - Originating VASP

The originating VASP (VASP(O)) initiates a transaction and is responsible for collecting and verifying the sender's and
recipient's details.

| Obligation                       | Description                                                                                                  |

## Conclusion

The FATF Travel Rule imposes strict compliance obligations on VASPs, custodial wallet providers, and other virtual asset
entities to prevent financial crimes such as money laundering and terrorist financing. **Regulated VASPs** have the most
stringent responsibilities, including the collection, verification, and transmission of originator and beneficiary PII.
**Offshore VASPs** and **custodial wallets** must also ensure compliance based on their jurisdictional regulations.
Meanwhile, **unhosted wallets** present additional challenges, requiring VASPs to implement identity verification
measures when interacting with them.

By adhering to these obligations, VASPs contribute to a more secure and transparent virtual asset ecosystem, ensuring
regulatory compliance and fostering trust among users and regulators.](https://git.toolsfdg.net/bigdata/protocols.git)
